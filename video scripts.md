# HeyZack Founder Story: Gary Abitbol

[SCENE START]

**[Opening Shot – Home Setting, Gary speaking directly to camera]**

**Gary (warm and engaging):**
"Hi, I'm Gary Abitbol. For over 15 years, I've been an entrepreneur, building successful businesses—from leading a major LED lighting company to ventures in real estate and renewable energy. For me, it’s always been about recognizing everyday problems and creating practical solutions."

**[Cut – brief visuals of complicated smart home setups]**

**Gary:**
"But my biggest frustration hit close to home—literally. While setting up my own smart home, I discovered just how fragmented everything was. You needed different apps for security, heating, lighting, and countless other tasks. It was confusing, frustrating, and frankly, expensive."

**[Back to Gary – conversational]**

**Gary:**
"That's why I created HeyZack. It's not just another smart home gadget—it's an intelligent guardian for your entire home."

**[Cut – visuals of HeyZack integrated seamlessly into daily routines]**

**Gary:**
"HeyZack is an all-in-one, AI-driven system covering security, comfort, and energy management. Imagine walking in after a long day; HeyZack recognizes you, unlocks your door, and adjusts your home’s temperature to exactly how you like it—no need for multiple apps or complex commands."

**[Gary – back to camera, enthusiastic and sincere]**

**Gary:**
"Our voice assistant understands natural language, so you can just say what you need, and it's done. And it doesn't just listen—it learns your habits and adapts to make your life easier."

**[Cut – visuals of family enjoying their comfortable home, with subtle demonstrations of HeyZack’s functionality]**

**Gary:**
"Whether it's preheating your bathroom in the morning, gently waking you with natural lighting, or automatically adjusting your heating to save on energy bills, HeyZack quietly handles it all in the background."

**[Gary – direct, reassuring]**

**Gary:**
"And here's the best part: it's affordable. With HeyZack, you can automate your entire home for under 1,000 Euros."
