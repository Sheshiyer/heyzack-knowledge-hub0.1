```
[INTRO - 0-30 seconds]
[Visual: Founder at home, surrounded by multiple smart home devices and apps on phone]

FOUNDER: "I'm [Name], founder of HeyZack. Three years ago, I was that guy with eleven different apps on my phone just to control my house. My wife called it 'David's expensive hobby' because she couldn't figure out how to dim the lights. Sound familiar?"

[PERSONAL STRUGGLE - 30-90 seconds]
[Visual: Founder demonstrating the frustration - switching between apps, devices not responding]

FOUNDER: "Every weekend, I'd spend hours troubleshooting instead of relaxing with my family. My five-year-old would ask, 'Daddy, why is our smart house so dumb?' That hit hard. I realized I'd created complexity, not comfort. My family was living around the technology instead of technology serving them."

[THE BREAKTHROUGH MOMENT - 90-150 seconds]
[Visual: Founder having a lightbulb moment, sketching on paper]

FOUNDER: "The breakthrough came when my daughter said, 'I wish I could just talk to the house like I talk to you.' That's when it clicked - homes should understand us, not the other way around. What if technology could anticipate our needs instead of waiting for commands?"

[SOLUTION DEMONSTRATION - 150-210 seconds]
[Visual: Natural family interactions, no phones or apps visible]

FOUNDER: "Watch this transformation. 'Hey Zack, I'm working from home today.'"
[Visual: Home seamlessly adjusts - perfect lighting, comfortable temperature, focus music]

FOUNDER: "One conversation. Seven devices. Four different brands. All working together like they were designed to. But more importantly - my family finally loves our smart home."

[EMOTIONAL PAYOFF - 210-260 seconds]
[Visual: Founder's family naturally interacting with their home, genuine smiles]

FOUNDER: "My wife now says our house feels like it cares about us. My daughter thinks it's magic. And me? I finally have my weekends back. Technology should enhance family time, not steal it. That's what we built - a home that understands your rhythm and enhances your life."

[CALL TO ACTION - 260-300 seconds]
[Visual: Founder speaking directly to camera, warm and authentic]

FOUNDER: "If you're tired of being the IT support for your own home, if you want technology that serves your family instead of frustrating them, HeyZack is for you. Early bird pricing ends soon, and there's a 30-day guarantee. Let's give your family the smart home they deserve - one that actually makes life easier."
