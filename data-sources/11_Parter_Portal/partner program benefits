### 5.1 MDF Explained
MDF (Market Development Funds) are individual co‑op marketing allowances. Your MDF accrues as a percentage of net purchases each quarter. Spend it on approved activities—trade shows, ads, demo gear—and Heyzack matches your outlay 1‑for‑1 with product credits or cash‑equivalent support. Balances reset every quarter and are tracked in your Partner Dashboard.
