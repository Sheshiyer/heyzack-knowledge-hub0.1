- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Now dynamically loads categories with document counts

### Task 0.3: Audit and Remove Unused Routes ✅

- **Action**: Remove all references to non-existent routes
- **Files**: All navigation components, link components
- **Expected**: Only valid routes remain in UI
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Removed invalid routes from categories page Quick Access

### Task 0.4: Update Navigation and Links ✅
- **Issue**: Broken links throughout the application
- **Action**: Update all href attributes to point to valid routes

- **Expected**: All navigation works correctly
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Updated homepage stats to use real data, fixed all navigation links

### Task 0.5: Update Homepage Statistics ✅
- **Issue**: Homepage shows hardcoded document counts and stats
- **Action**: Replace with real data from DocumentService.getStats()
- **Files**: `src/app/page.tsx`
- **Expected**: Dynamic stats showing actual document counts and last updated time
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Homepage now shows real document statistics with loading states
